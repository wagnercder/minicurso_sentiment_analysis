@VirginAmerica I miss the #nerdbird in San Jose
@VirginAmerica love it, taking @SouthwestAir on in their backyard! Consumers win when biz competes.
@VirginAmerica ​ is flying from Love to Austin now. That is most excellent news.
@VirginAmerica can we make every VX plane with #nerdbird? Why should Austin be the only one getting nerd love?
@VirginAmerica please add more frequency to PDX Portland
@VirginAmerica Congrats VX on the new route! ️
@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
@VirginAmerica @AmericanAir can u help with flights to get a 2y old battling cancer who needs treatment in  @FreyaBevan_Fund   
@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?
@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
@VirginAmerica does Virgin America fly direct from Seattle to NYC or Boston?
@VirginAmerica That's classy.
@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
@VirginAmerica now it's just t-minus 32 minutes until my Elevate a Silver upgrade window opens . #FreeNeverSucks 
@VirginAmerica save some for 871 tomorrow AM!
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.

@VirginAmerica ...Please come to Minneapolis St. Paul!
@VirginAmerica YES FYI  MY BFF
@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?

@VirginAmerica I love the dancing little richard. cool beans.

@VirginAmerica Dad on Segway is the best part of this whole infographic!
@VirginAmerica Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :)
@VirginAmerica wifi AND better seating.
@VirginAmerica how come ABC is the only one of the network channels you don't have?
@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
.@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience
@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
@VirginAmerica Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!
@VirginAmerica should use this in their next airline commercial lol :: http://t.co/pXEXIlSjBs
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)…tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)
@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
@VirginAmerica you guys are perfect as always! &lt;3 #WeRVirgin
@VirginAmerica thanks! Y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry.
@VirginAmerica Can you give me Silver Status for 12 months?
@VirginAmerica really wish you'd fly out of #Fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings
@VirginAmerica mood lighting on point Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 
@VirginAmerica Are there any sign up bonuses to enroll in Elevate?
@VirginAmerica just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome
@VirginAmerica morning. If I have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can I DM you?
@VirginAmerica still waiting to see  @Starryeyes_Dev_  
@VirginAmerica was wondering if you guys recieved my dm and we're able to potentially respond asap
@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
“@VirginAmerica: Book out of town with fares from $59/way (+restr). http://t.co/xRdTOV7nl8 http://t.co/4Y78byAckc” @JenniferDawnPro
@united thanks
@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.
@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.
@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta
@united thanks
@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
@united follow me please this airline is beautifull 
@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system.
@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
@united Just submitted my response on the link you sent.
@united yes, David Allan send an email with this number (KMM24999563V99860L0KM) and case#8719519
@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated
@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015
@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?
@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
@united thats weak. See ya 
Hey @VirginAmerica !!
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
@united I lost a voucher that I was given in Miami aeroport on jan 26. I did not use it.
@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but...
@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations
@united i DMed you the details
@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was "Inop". I love a good abbreve.
@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@united "Airport snow removal method #22..."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU
@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
@united rude rude
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united 6533 ORD to DCA
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told "we can't find a supervisor."
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@united I will not be flying you again
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
@united v upset with your disability  "services". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude.
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat.
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you . I sincerely hope they can help me!!
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@united thx for update
@united thank you !
@united dm these nuts
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy.
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Thank you.
@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ️out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@united please be good to me this weekend!
@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@united yall should probably work on that.
@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@united how about 3659 YUL-ORD?
@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@united Done and done
@united thanks, just sent :)
@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united thnx for the info
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united Okay thank you
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united you are one great airline ️
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
“@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN” We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@united yes I do.
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: "Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
@united good to know you will open the closed doors for "premier passengers" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
@united DM sent
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united But thanks for asking
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
@united you too!
@united is my favorite airline.
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@united why would they make me share a room?
@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
@united i understand, thanks
@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like
@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible "provide a death certificate' policy
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@united I hope so too
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
@united where is my flight voucher?
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever!  #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while..
@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
@united thank you.
Decisions Decisions @MandarinJourney @united:  We'd love for you to try our service. We offer status match too. http://t.co/xbQqqbRgVF ^KP”
Need more info on that! @united: @momsgoodeats We have great amenity kits. PJ's not included. We status match AA. ^KP”
@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a "wrong" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.
@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
“@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united Dmed you. Thank you
@united thanks we'll be in touch!
@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?
@united like continental's chicken feat fairs

@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
Yes!! Thanks so much!!! “@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY”
@united captain "on behalf of the front office, welcome on board.".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?

@united These are great fares!!!!!
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@United so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ️
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ️️
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious "costs" that you incur, @united?
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
@united Thank you!
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i "have" to fly with you.
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.
http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW vía @usatoday
@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
